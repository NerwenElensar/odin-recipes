    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Top this spicy lime and avocado soup with sour cream or crème fraîche and serve it with
      warm tortilla chips and a nice large mojito if desired. My husband tried to tell me not
      to submit this recipe, as he didn’t want the whole world to know about it. But I say,
      share what you have!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large white onion, chopped, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped cilantro, divided</li>
      <li>2 jalapeño peppers, halved and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 limes, juiced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons reduced-sodium chicken bouillon powder</li>
      <li>3 large firm, ripe avocados, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>¼ cup crumbled queso fresco, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add chicken; boil until an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about
        7 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run cool water over chicken to speed cooling process. Shred or finely slice chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1/2 of the onion, 1/2 cup cilantro,
        jalapeño peppers, lime juice, and garlic; cook until onion is slightly greenish in
        color, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 4 cups water and bouillon powder in a small bowl; pour into the pot. Cook until
        just heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle soup into four bowls. Top with remaining avocado, onion, cilantro, and queso
        fresco.
      </li>
    </ol>
